<h1>My Student Bio</h1>	
<p>
I am a three-year graduate of the University of Southern California with a Bachelor of Science degree in Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Studies from the Keck School of Medicine. </p>
<p>
As a US citizen and a permanent resident of Hong Kong, I hope to apply my experience with clinical research and public health towards management of research projects and development of novel technologically-based healthcare outlets not only in the United States, but also an international setting. After graduating, I am also excited to pursue an advanced clinical degree in medicine or nursing in addition to these other opportunities. </p>
<p>
Whether you have a new challenge for me to tackle or a restaurant recommendation that I have to try, feel free to contact me nathanhleung@gmail.com</p>
